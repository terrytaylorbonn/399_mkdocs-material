History:
- 1 docs.ziptieai.com was originally planned as a site that published the wiki content for AI drones (the original content was created in this wiki because its much easier and simpler to update than a website).  
- 2 Half a year later the focus switched to tech stacks (MERN).
- 3 A few months later the focus switched to AI stacks (the current and final focus). 
- 4 (TODO) docs.ziptieai.com needs to be replaced with a new site that includes  
  - mainly AI stack wiki content
  - some tech stack content
  - minimal AI drone content

<br/>

Current best site:
- [docs3.ziptieai.com](https://docs3.ziptieai.com) (redirect). AI stacks sandbox Docusaurus site.

Site that will probably become docs.ziptie.ai site:
- [docs4.ziptieai.com](https://docs4.ziptieai.com) (redirect). AI stacks sandbox Mkdocs site. Full featured, content has not been updated with ZiptieAI content yet.

Other
- [docs2.ziptieai.com](https://docs2.ziptieai.com) (redirect). Basic Docusaurus skeleton site.
- [docs.ziptieai.com](https://docs.ziptieai.com). Old RTD deploy. Content is for drones (outdated). Need to replace this (probably with docs4.ziptieai.com Mkdocs version).
