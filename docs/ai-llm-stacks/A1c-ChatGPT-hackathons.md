Goals
- 0 to HERO demos, from scratch, using GPT
- Go off on tangents, like HD partitions, docker config, etc.

Temporary focus summer 2025: 
- Local models that I can use in late summer while I am in mainland China 
- no (safe, reliable) internet access to LLM infrastructure 
- keep my main working PCs offline as a safety precaution
- therefore: need locals models I can work on while there
